    "Both masked images (`lsst.afw.image.MaskedImageF`, etc) and exposures (`lsst.afw.image.ExposureF`, etc) provide an image with associated mask and variance planes. When serialized to FITS, they are stored as successive extensions in a multi-extension FITS file (MEF). See [LSST Doxygen](https://lsst-web.ncsa.illinois.edu/doxygen/x_masterDoxyDoc/afw_sec_image_i_o.html) for details.\n",

However, when the user tries to load a arbitrary multi-extension FITS file using our code, the unexpected can happen. For example, it's easy to end up with \"image\" N+2 in fact be the variance of image N:"

    "The starting point for this was [suggested by Simon Krughoff](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-2599?focusedCommentId=34658&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-34658), but there are a bunch of corner cases which are extensively covered in the [unit tests](https://github.com/lsst/afw/blob/master/tests/maskedImageIO.py#L191). Specifically, we attempt to make this as safe as possible by handling the following situations. Note that Exposures always set `needAllHdus` to `false`.\n",

    "  * If the user has specified a non-default HDU:\n",
    "    * If the user specified HDU is unreadable, we throw.\n",

    "    * If the default HDU is unreadable, we throw.\n",

    "\n",
    "Further: when we write data to a MEF, we add an `EXTTYPE` header to indicate the type of data being written (`IMAGE`, `MASK` or `VARIANCE`). This header is checked when the data is read, and an error thrown if the data being read is of the wrong type. However, it was decided that it was not possible simply to throw an error if the header is missing: the header as not been consistently added in all past versions of the code, and it would cause too much backwards incompatibility. However, to help the user, we log warnings if the expected header isn't found."
